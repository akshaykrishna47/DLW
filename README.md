# EcoComfort: Revolutionizing Sustainable Climate Control

*Inspired by the surging space cooling demand, projected to triple by 2050, EcoComfort strives for sustainability in shared spaces.*

## Smart Climate Control with EcoComfort

EcoComfort is not just a program; it's an advanced solution that predicts and optimizes air conditioner temperature for shared spaces. Leveraging predictive modeling and reinforcement learning, it dynamically adjusts settings based on energy consumption, user preferences, and external factors like occupancy and outside temperature. This results in a tailored, energy-efficient indoor climate, addressing the urgent need to minimize energy usage for space cooling.

## Meticulous Construction

EcoComfort wasn't built overnight. It emerged through meticulous steps:
- Simulating real-world scenarios for data generation.
- Developing a Random Forest model for energy consumption prediction.
- Creating a custom OpenAI Gym environment for simulation.
- Implementing the core with a Deep Q Network (DQN) architecture trained via a replay memory mechanism.
